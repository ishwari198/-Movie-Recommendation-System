# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview

This project is a movie recommendation system based on English movies. The application utilizes data extracted from IMDb using web scraping techniques, specifically using Beautiful Soup. It provides comprehensive details about a requested movie, including its overview, genre, release date, rating, runtime, top cast, reviews, recommended movies, and more.

1. Create an account on TMDb.
2. Click on the API link from the left-hand sidebar in your account settings.
3. Fill in all the required details to apply for an API key.
4. If asked for the website URL, enter "NA" if you don't have one.
5. Once your request is approved, you will find the API key in your API sidebar.
